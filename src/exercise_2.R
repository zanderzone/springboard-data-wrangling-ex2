# Think about other ways you could have populated the 
# missing values in the age column. Why would you pick 
# any of those over the mean (or not)?

## You can choose to use the age of the previous row.  
## This would not work if the age is from the first record.
## That record would not have a previous age to use.
## You can also try to interpolate based on last and next 
## age values.  The same problem is encountered as 
## with using the previous age value.  

# Youâ€™re interested in looking at the distribution of passengers 
# in different lifeboats, but as we know, many passengers did not make 
# it to a boat :-( This means that there are a lot of missing values 
# in the boat column. Fill these empty slots with a dummy value
# e.g. the string 'None' or 'NA'
raw$boat[is.na(raw$boat)] <- "None"

# Create a new column has_cabin_number which has 1 if there is a cabin number,
# and 0 otherwise.
